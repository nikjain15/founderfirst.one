## Email Body - COPY & PASTE

It's 2026. Your customer just asked their AI: *"Find affordable kids' sneakers under $50 with good reviews."*

Within seconds, the AI searched 47 stores, compared prices, read reviews, and completed the purchase.

Your store wasn't even considered.

**This isn't hypothetical. It's happening right now.**

The numbers are staggering:
- **4,700% year-over-year** increase in AI traffic to retail (mid-2025)
- **4X higher conversion rates** for AI-assisted shopping (12.3% vs 3.1%)
- Market growing from **$8.65B (2025) → $22.6B (2032)**

Most merchants have no idea.

**Here's the problem: Agents aren't humans.**

They don't browse. Don't impulse buy. They run a ruthless checklist:

1. **Can I find it?** → Is your product data accessible?
2. **Should I buy here?** → Are you competitive?
3. **Will checkout work?** → Is it fast & simple?
4. **Will it arrive perfect?** → Is fulfillment reliable?
5. **Can I trust you?** → Are you consistent?

Fail any of these, the agent chooses a competitor.

**Where to start:**

Which of these five is your biggest weakness? Fix that first.

Messy product data? → Fix that.
Clunky checkout? → Streamline it.
Unreliable fulfillment? → Make it your obsession.

The merchants who get this right will dominate agent-driven commerce in 2026. Everyone else will fade.

For now: Start thinking about your customers as agents. They're automated, efficient, and unforgiving.
