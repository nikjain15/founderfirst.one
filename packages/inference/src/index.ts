 * adapters are imported directly by their runtime to avoid pulling runtime
 * globals into this entry:
 *   - Worker:    import { resolveOnWorkers } from "<rel>/packages/inference/src/adapters/workers"
 *   - Deno (fn): import { resolveOnDeno }    from "<rel>/packages/inference/src/adapters/deno.ts"
 *   - Node (CI): import { resolveOnNode }    from "@ff/inference/adapters/node"
