AI agents are becoming the new shoppers. Powered by ChatGPT and Perplexity, they search, compare, and buy on behalf of millions. The protocols making this possible—Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) and Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)—are open standards that let any merchant participate, regardless of size.

## How It Works in Practice

A customer asks their AI assistant: "Find affordable kids' sneakers under $50 with good reviews." The AI searches, compares prices, checks stock, and makes a purchase—all in seconds. 

Your store gets found only if your products are agent-ready. With ACP and UCP, any merchant can declare their capabilities and get discovered. It's simple: integrate the protocol, optimize your product data, and let agents drive traffic to you.

## The Opportunity

The numbers tell the story:

- **AI Traffic:** Generative AI traffic to retail sites increased 4,700% YoY (mid-2025)
- **Conversions:** AI-assisted shopping drives 4X higher conversion rates (12.3% vs 3.1%)
- **Market Size:** AI e-commerce projected to grow from $8.65B (2025) to $22.6B (2032)
- **B2B Scale:** AI agents will handle $15 trillion in B2B purchases by 2028

This growth isn't limited to big players. Early adopters of all sizes are seeing real wins. The protocols—ACP for secure payments, UCP for discovery—level the playing field.
